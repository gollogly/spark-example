The Example uses some Example Wiki Data available in the Pluralsight Course documentation

* plugins.sbt must be placed under the **project** folder
* The assembly plugin is used to include the non spark dependencies in a **fat jar**

# Building the Example

```
sbt assembly
```

# Running the Example

```
spark-submit --class main.Evaluator target\scala-2.10\Language-Evaluator-0.1.jar
```
